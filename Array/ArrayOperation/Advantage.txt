_______=====Advantage of Array=====______________________

Allows contiguous memory location
Access Time T(n) = O(1);
Can store data of same type using single variable,

_______=====Disadvantage of Array=====______________________
Insertion Time Complexity T(n) = O(n);
Deletion Time complexity T(n) = O(n);
Size of array should be known in advance
Wastage of memory if data is not stored as per the size of array declared.
